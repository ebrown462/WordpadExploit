Wordpad Exploit in Windows 10/11
----------------

In many cases when certain users have limited privileges on a system, the use of cmd and/or powershell is
blocked. The use of certain file types can be blocked too such as .exe, .bat, .vbs, etc.

A way around this is through the use of wordpad which is usually unblocked on most systems.

- First write the malicious script in a textfile and save it to an accessible location as the desired file type e.g. "script.bat". If this doesn't work try have the script on a USB

- Next open a new wordpad document

- Click on "insert object", select "Create from file", and then "Browse". Then select the script and click "OK".

- Once the object is added double click on it, and click on run.

Even if a user is blocked from running the file type, it will still run. 

In addition, once added inside the wordpad document, it does not use the original file but copies it. This means that if the original file is deleted/detected, the wordpad file wont be affected.

I've also found that the script inside is undetectable by windows defender (as of Windows 11 10.0.22621) once inside the wordpad document.

Without administrator privileges there isn't too much damage that can be done on its own, but with the correct knowledge it makes privilege escalation easier when cmd or powershell is blocked.
